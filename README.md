# Fetch-Api
This project contains fetch api which fetch some data from an external api

fetch() allows you to make network requests similar to XMLHttpRequest (XHR).
The main difference is that the Fetch API uses Promises, which enables
a simpler and cleaner API, avoiding callback hell and having to remember
 the complex API of XMLHttpRequest

 If you've never used Promises before, check out Introduction
  to JavaScript Promises.
